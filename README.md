# VBA-Assignment
This is a VBA file where I ran commands to learn how to edit VBA and macros on MS Excel.

Questions I tried to answer by the way of Excel VBA.

1. Create a For loop to repeat a task 5 times using the variable i. Your answer should be two lines.
2. Use a For loop to start at 100 and end at 0, decreasing by ten for each step.
3. Loop through each cell in range "a1:a100" and set each cell's value equal to the cell directly to its right (Hint: use offset(0,1) to look at the cell directly to the right. We will learn more about this feature in the chapter on advanced cell referencing)
4. Use a Do loop to repeat a task only while variable testvalue > 100.
5. Test if five is less than or equal to 3 and assign the result to the variable "Test"
6. Test if n > 100 with an IF Statement. Set note = "check" if TRUE else note = "immaterial"
7. Use a Select Case statement to test if variable "animal" is equal to "cat" or "dog" and output "meow" or "woof" to the variable "sound" if there is a match.
8. Test if a number n is less than or equal to 3 or greater than or equal to 10 by using the "Or" operator.
9. Add another Elseif to the previous example to test if animal = "Cow." If TRUE, then create a message box that says "Moo."
10. Get the row number of the named range "drate" and assign it to a variable "row_num."
11. Create a Yes/No message box titled "20 Questions" and prompt "Is it an animal?". Assign the answer to the variable "vInput."
12. Now, create the same message box with buttons=vbYesNoCancel instead to add a cancel option.
13. Create an InputBox with the prompt "How old are you?" and assign the input to the variable "myValue."
14. Create an InputBox with the prompt "How old are you?" and assign the input to the variable "myValue." Also, add the title "Age" and default value 21 to the InputBox.
15. Create a sub-procedure titled "HelloWorld."
16. Assign the value of 2 to cell A2.
17. Assign the value of the "string of text" to cell A3.
18. Assign the value of "EZ" to cell A3 by separating "EZ" into two strings of text and combining them.
19. Assign the value of .05 to the named range "drate."
20. Assign the value of 5 to cells A2:B3. Hint: Enter the range exactly how it would appear in an Excel formula.
